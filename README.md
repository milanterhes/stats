# Profile data api

## The plan:
- [ ] API written in Typescript with Express
- [ ] OpenAPI + Swagger interface
- [ ] Instagram profile data
- [ ] Lens protocol profile data
---
Bonus
- [ ] Persistance / Cache
- [ ] Frontend
- [ ] Auth

### The API
- `/stats/instagram/{handle}` - returns Instagram profile data
- `/stats/lens/{handle}` - returns Lens profile data


## Notes

- Instagram and Lens was chosen because they both have public APIs. Might add another one that needs authorization later.
